## Customization

### Modifying The Theme

The default theme is placed in the `theme` folder, run `npm install` and `npm run build` to rebuild in this folder.

page `page.html` (article list) and `article.html` (article), use variable with [Golang Template](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) syntax.

### New Page

Created any `.html` file will be copied to `source` directory, could use all variables on `site` field in `config.yml`.


#### Define Custom Variables
InkPaper supports defining custom variables in pages, which must be placed under `site.config` in `config.yaml`, such as:

``` yaml
site:
    config:
        MyVar: "Hello World"
```

The variable can be referenced in the page by `{{.Site.Config.MyVar}}`.

> **Note**
>
> Although the field names in other parts of `config.yaml` are all lowercase, the name of the custom variable must be used correctly. Otherwises, such a variable:
>
> ```yaml
> site:
>     config:
>         MYVAR_aAa: "Hello World"
> ```
> must be referenced in the page as `{{.Site.Config.MYVAR_aAa}}`.

#### Use Functions (Experimental)

InkPaper defines a minimal set of functions that can be used in HTML pages (except for `.md` source files), such as

``` yaml
{{ readFile "path/to/file" }}
```

This will read the content of the file `path/to/file` and include it in the page without any processing.

For file-related functions, when executed in the `source` directory, the file path is relative to the `source` directory; when executed in other directories, the file path is relative to the theme (such as `theme`).

See the source file `funcs.go` for a list of all functions.

### Blog Migration (Beta)

Supports simple Jeklly/Hexo post convertions. Usage:

``` shell
ink convert /path/_posts
```
